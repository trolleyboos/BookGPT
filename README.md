# BookGPT
  BookGPT is a collection of javascript bookmarklets made using OpenAI's ChatGPT engine. Every once in a while, we ask the ChatGPT engine to create us a bookmarklet to help everybody. ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning) with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge.


BookGPT is a bmklt.svcs.ga project.
